# Working with Newbies

Incorporating folks with very little software development experience is core to how Ruby for Good operates. We've found that they can often bring fresh insight and give good perspective on the projects. However, given their lack of experience, they can often been hesitant to speak up, or jump into tasks they've never faced before. One of the roles of the team lead is to help these team members feel comfortable, safe and willing to help.

1. Write up issues clearly. Often you can have a more senior member of the team write up issues in detail that a junior can grab it and knock it out. This might wind up taking the senior developer more time to write the issue than to Just Fix It, but this is worthwhile. The more experience the junior dev can get the more familiar they will be with the code base and more confident and useful they will be.
2. Standups. While it is up to the team lead, we often recommend standups twice a day. This might seem like a lot of meetings, but we focus on keeping the standups short and making sure the team is all working in concert toward the goal. And a fantastic time to identify tasks that junior developers can handle, as well as ensure nobody is blocked on current tasks.
3. Pair Programming. Where possible it is good to have junior developers pair. Either with senior folks or with other junior devs.
