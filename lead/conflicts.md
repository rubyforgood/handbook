# Conflict Resolution

Hopefully there will be no conflicts between team members. And our experience at Ruby for Good these are very few and far between. But conflicts can arise, especially with a large group of people together in close quarters, working hard on projects they care strongly about.

Anticipate any problems. This is normally as simple as paying attention to the team. Remember your job is to lead the team, not necessary implement the project. Trust you people to do their job, and you can step back and watch to make sure there are no tensions or hurt feelings developing.

If you sense any problems, and are comfortable approaching everyone involved, we urge you to have an open dialog and get the issue in the open. It is very rare for people to attend Ruby for Good and not want to collaborate and help out, but if there is any reason you are not comfortable with this level of communication bring it to the attention of the organizers.

You should feel free to approach the organizers at any time, especially if you would like advice for dealing with interpersonal issues. At any time feel free to seek out any of the organizers and they will either help you, or track down the person who can.

Not all conflicts are worth resolving. Since this is a short event, is may be preferable to switch team. We discourage this, since we don't want people just jumping from team-to-team to find the new shiny thing. But if it is needed it can be done. Please discuss with the organizers and we can work to find an alternate team.
